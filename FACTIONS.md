## The Road Ahead

As the Republic faces growing challenges - pirate attacks in the Outer Rim, corporate corruption scandals, and rising social tensions - each faction offers different solutions. The Yellows, as the player party, must navigate these treacherous political waters while staying true to their pro-Jedi, anti-corporate principles. Will they strengthen their coalition, reach across the aisle to the opposition, or risk government collapse in pursuit of their ideals?

The choices made in the coming months will determine not just the fate of the current government, but the very character of the Galactic Republic itself.
